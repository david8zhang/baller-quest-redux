# Baller Quest Redux

- A 3 vs 3 basketball minigame

## TODO:

- Different sprites for CPU v.s. Player
- Animations for defending
- Dribbling around defenders

## Bugs

- Set screen bug where team mate keeps running forever
- Defensive switch mix-up: Call for a screen, then while defense is switching, pass to another player (causing enemy to mistakenly double-team)
