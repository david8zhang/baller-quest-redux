# Baller Quest Redux

- A 3 vs 3 basketball minigame

## TODO:

- Dribble moves
- Post Up + Fadeaway moves

## Bugs

- Sometimes the shot arc is weird (hard to repro, usually happens after a block and immediately shooting after possession change)
- Spamming steal is a viable strategy that goes unpunished
